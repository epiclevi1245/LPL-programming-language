# LPL-programming-language
# How to download!
the diffrent versions are in diffrent branches of the project, the main is currently empty because the state of the programming language is years from being remotley finished!
the current version is beta-0.2, if you're wondering what happened to 0.1, I lost it, too bad
# How it works
the programming language is coded in python and javascrpt, I'm hoping to get it moved over to javascript entierly when the features im working currently are done
as with python, the language is interpreted, so its VERY SLOW, coded in python and being interpreted so thats where the javascript comes in, some features require node.js as they're coded in javascript instead of python for added speed.
# Requirements
Python 3 or above and
Node.js (a version that isn't archeaic should work)
and the LPL source code
# How to use
cd into the directory with main.py
make a .lpl file in your text editor
code (instructions in the wiki!)
once you're done coding just run
```
python3 main.py <filename not including .lpl>
```
and it should run and give you the output
for debug versions of LPL it will print all the files characters and the tokens array, which is the bit thats actually interpreted, it would be way to hard to directly interpret the file.
# Version
to get the version you need if you're a regular user of LPL just go into the releases folder, and download the most recent one,
more advanced users will want to get a debug release if they're code isn't working and it will give you an idea of how the language is actually handling it.
